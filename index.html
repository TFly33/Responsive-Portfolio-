          I'm a 31 year old living in Center City, Philadelphia with my wife and two dogs.
          I grew up in Chicago, Frankfurt Germany, and Northern Virginia.
          I played Division 1 baseball at Mount Saint Mary's University in Emmitsburg, Maryland from
          2007-2011 (<a href="https://www.mountathletics.com/sports/bsb/2010-11/bios/flynn_tommy00?view=bio">here's my
            bio</a>).
          Once I realized I couldn't hit a curveball and wouldn't make it as a pro, I decided to go to law school.

        <p id="second">
          I graduated from George Mason School of Law in 2014. I'm barred to practice law in both Virginia and
          Pennsylvania.
          I've worked in International Aviation Law (I know, random) and currently am an associate attorney working in
          real estate law.
          I also have some startup experience. I was the first hire at a youth sports sponsorship startup in Philly and
          previously co-founded a peer-to-peer editing platform (it no longer exists...turns out people don't like
          things edited).

          I'm also an obsessive hobbyist. I am a part-time professional poker player, a Class-A chess player
          (<a href="https://www.moron2master.com">follow my journey to master here!</a>), an amateur card magician, and
          occasionally a writer
          (<a href="https://medium.com/@tfly.flynn">here are some articles from the past</a>). I'm always looking to
          meet new people and experience new things.
